# YoutubeDLGUI
Cross-platform GUI interface for the powerful command-line YouTube downloader, youtube-dl.

A version of youtube-dl is included and can be enabled through the options menu. However, it is the default behavior, and recommended, to download youtube-dl and place it on your path (or just install it).
